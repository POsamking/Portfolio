<p>I am an aspiring software developer skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with strong problem-solving and communication abilities. My journey in tech began after a significant career shift. I previously worked as an associate and pursued my dream of becoming a professional boxer. Unfortunately, an injury ended my aspirations, forcing me to reconsider my career path.

    The turning point came when I visited a friend and saw him coding. Intrigued by the creativity and logic involved, I realised that software development was my true calling. Driven by this newfound passion, I recently completed a comprehensive software development course.

    With a background that combines resilience, discipline, and a constant drive for improvement, I am excited to contribute to meaningful projects and make a positive difference through coding.
